   <h3>Carta #1</h3>
    
       <blockquote>  This pandemic is an opportunity to connect with yourself more, that can be overwhelming. One of the things I miss the most is not going for a walk, and not getting to  see the  people I care about that often. Since we’re in lockdown I try to make art activities such as painting and playing the violin. When I feel bad I try to talk with myself and with a person of trust. Sometimes I can be so sad that the conversation can get a bit bad, though :(.  I'm trying to learn how to deal with my crisis moments, and I've learnt a  thing or two about pies. After this  pandemic is over I think that, at least for a  while, we will appreciate each other more.</blockquote>

   <h3>Carta #2</h3>
    
       <blockquote> I have felt depressed, but getting in touch with books, writing and doing exercise has helped me not to fall deeper. I think the biggest challenge for me has been fighting against anxiety, but I try to get in touch with my family. I try not to exceed my activity on social networks. Besides that, writing and reading stories about loss has been a very useful strategy to reach peace and increase my empathy. </blockquote>

								<h3>Carta #3</h3>
							<blockquote> In mi opinion, the pandemic in Mexico has been living as if it wasn’t real. People haven’t taken the appropriate precautions to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Meanwhile, there's  much concern about economic crisis that is getting close. It reflects an inefficient government with late public health strategies on prevention. I'm worried about what is coming in Mexico, my developing country in which I’m going to be a doctor. </blockquote>

						<div style="background-color:SteelBlue">
						     <h3> Carta #4 </h3>
				<blockquote> I’m happy to stay home actually - I get to paint, read, think, rest, analyze my life and whether it is on the path that I enjoy.  I have not faced any significant challenge and I don’t have a problem with isolation. It’s nothing special for me. I’ve found this rather a peaceful time for myself and my many interests :). I think that after this is over ...we will either be slaves or raise and be free and happy as we should be... </blockquote>

									       <div style="background-color:MediumPurple">
                <h3>Carta #5</h3>
							<blockquote>Basically I  have been horny, depressed and obsessed with food. I have enjoyed having so much free time, unfortunately I don’t know  what to do with it.  I can't stand online classes, I'm stressed cause I feel that I am not learning a thing.  The lockdown has been new and comfortable but honestly I am done. I’ve learnt from this pandemic that relationships are based on one’s patience. </blockquote>

                <h3>Carta #6</h3>
							<blockquote> I am 100%  locked down at home. There are no people to chat nor play nor share. I miss enjoying  little walks! </blockquote>
