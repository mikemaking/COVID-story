## COVIDstory is dedicated to collect human stories during the COVID-19 pandemic and then share those stories whose owner allows us to do so.

The objective of COVIDstory is to set up a platform where we can all learn from humans' experiences around the globe. 

Submissions to improve the logistics and design of the platform are welcome.

# Thanks for passing by!
